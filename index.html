	<h1> About Me </h1>
		<p> Hi my name is Michael Whalley.</p> 
		<p> I am a first year Bachelor of IT student at RMIT university in Melbourne, Victoria, my hometown. Prior to this course I completed High School at Essendon Kelior College and completed an Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering, also at RMIT. Thanks to the latter I have a relatively lower Student ID of S3506606. </p>
		<p> English is the only language I currently know although I hope to learn many programing languages and another spoken language eventually... Don't really have any hobies besides reading, and watching the occassional TV program. </p>
	<h2> My Interest In IT. </h2>
		<p> My interest interest in IT began very young, I can remember making web pages like this in Word when I was ~5 yo, although they were never very good or detailed. most of my IT expeience is in helping others out with the IT needs and confusions, or with my previously mentioned Advanced Diploma. </p>
		<p> During my studies I expect to learn about IT systems development and administration, and to <i>some</i> degree programming.  </p>
		<p> RMIT is my University of choice as it is relatively easy to access, has a good reputation, <i> and another reason I have blanked on as I try to write it here. </i> </p>
		<p> I have a minor hobby in electronics. Generally just throwing around designs of random things that I would then like to build but don't actually get around to doing so. </p>

	<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>

	<h2> Project Idea </h2>
		<p> Build and configure a Raspberry Pi based Alarm Clock with internal USB phone and Laptop charger. This would then be programmed using what ever coding language the team thinks best to perform different funtions and to interact with via an app or web page available through the pi. </p>
		<p> The motivation for this is that while phones are good alarm clocks their display is not always the best for casually displaying the time, the alarm clock would not need to be charged to work, and could have as loud alarm as you want. Additionally I need a new phone charger for home and this would also perform that function. </p>
		<p> Non-conclusive list of functions: 
		<ul>
			<li> Tell the time in a maner that does not interfer with sleep and is updated via NTP (Network Time Protocol). </li>
			<li> Charge multiple USB devices quickly (>2A 5VDC) with or with out a data connection to the Pi. </li>
			<li> Sound potentially Multiple alarms as set via an App or a self hosted web site. Potentiall with Calender integration. </li>
		</ul> 
		</p>
	<p> Secondary/optional Functions
		<ul>
			<li> Play music via bluetooth, or network connection </li>
			<li> Battery back-up for time and alarm functions </li>
			<li> Speak the time, silence the alarm, and possibly perform other functions with the aid of a built in camera of PIR sensor </li>
			<li> act as a wired smoke alarm and.or fire detector for the occupant(s) of the room/building. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p> Although propablby achievable using an Arduino or similar microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi makes more sense due to its low cost with existing network integration (wireless on Pi 3). Some soldering may be required for the expansion board connected to the Pi's GPIO Header. An IDE for the programming language used would be needed while programming the Pi's software after the OS has been loaded on to the SD card (likely Raspbian). EAGLE would be needed to design the Circuit board previously mentioned along with some electronics skills. </p>
	<p> Skills needed: Soldering, Programming the Pi to achieve the functions desired, installing the OS an any other needed software on the Pi, Electronics: (designing a Circuit board and other internal circuits/components of the Alarm Clock), Not being afarid of a little 240VAC... </p>
	<p> if the project is completed successfully the Alarm Clock should be able to tell the time to the user both visually and audably, play music, and charge different USB devices. It will also have replaced the need for multiple extension chords, plugboards, adapters, other stuff near the end of my bed that pose a slight fire risk. It's impact would be on improved safety and comfort of the User/Owner </p>
	<p> Additional note: all hardware costs would be met by who ever ends up with the end product (if any). </p>
