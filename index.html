	<h1> About Me </h1>
		<p> Hi my name is Michael Whalley.</p> 
		<p> I am a first year Bachelor of IT student at RMIT university in Melbourne, Victoria, my hometown. Prior to this course I completed High School at Essendon Kelior College and completed an Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering, also at RMIT. Thanks to the latter I have a relatively lower Student ID of S3506606. </p>
		<p> English is the only language I currently know although I hope to learn many programing languages and another spoken language eventually... Don't really have any hobies besides reading, and watching the occassional TV program. </p>
	<h2> My Interest In IT. </h2>
		<p> My interest interest in IT began very young, I can remember making web pages like this in Word when I was ~5 yo, although they were never very good or detailed. most of my IT expeience is in helping others out with the IT needs and confusions, or with my previously mentioned Advanced Diploma. </p>
		<p> During my studies I expect to learn about IT systems development and administration, and to <i>some</i> degree programming.  </p>
		<p> RMIT is my University of choice as it is relatively easy to access, has a good reputation, <i> and another reason I have blanked on as I try to write it here. </i> </p>
